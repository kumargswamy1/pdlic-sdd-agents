# PDLC Context Management System - Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

You now have a complete **Context Management System** that:

1. **Centralizes project context** in easily discoverable standard files
2. **Automatically detects** your tech stack and creates standards
3. **Maintains synchronization** as your project evolves
4. **Provides single source of truth** for all downstream PDLC agents
5. **Preserves traceability** from business drivers through implementation

All existing agents (Specifier, Planner, Builder, Tester) now read from this unified context, eliminating ambiguity and ensuring consistent implementation.

## Traceability Flow

### ID Types

**CTX-* IDs** (Created by Context Creator)
- Track business context elements
- Examples: CTX-BUSINESS-001, CTX-TECH-002, CTX-COMPLIANCE-003
- Appear in: `requirement/Context_{ProjectName}.md` and `Traceability_Matrix.md`
- Lifetime: Project foundation (created once, reference throughout)

**CTX-UPDATE-* IDs** (Created by Context Updater)
- Track context changes and evolution
- Examples: CTX-UPDATE-001, CTX-UPDATE-002
- Appear in: Change history in context documents
- Lifetime: Created as needed, closed after re-validation

**Downstream IDs** (Created by other agents)
- FR-*, NFR-* - Requirements
- SPEC-* - Specifications
- TASK-* - Implementation tasks
- CODE-* - Code changes
- TEST-* - Test coverage
- All link back to CTX-* and CTX-UPDATE-* via Traceability_Matrix.md

- Traceability Manager tracks complete context lifecycle

### New Capabilities ✅
- Automatic tech stack detection
- Three synchronized standards files
- Mid-project context synchronization
- Change impact tracking
- Conflict detection between specs and standards

### Migration Path ✅

- Optional adoption: Run Context Creator when ready
- No forced changes to current workflows
- Gradual integration as projects evolve

---

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (Project Kickoff)
- ✅ Context Creator creates all 4 standards files
- ✅ CTX-* IDs created and tracked
- ✅ All downstream agents can read context
- ✅ Specs/plans use detected tech standards

### Short Term (First 4 Weeks)
- ✅ Specifier validates designs against standards
- ✅ Planner structures tasks per standards
- ✅ Builder implements using standard patterns
- ✅ Tester creates tests matching standards
- ✅ Zero contradictions between context and specs

### Medium Term (Ongoing)
- ✅ Context Updater detects all changes
- ✅ Standards stay in sync with project evolution
- ✅ Specs/plans updated when standards change
- ✅ CTX-UPDATE-* IDs track all changes
- ✅ Traceability Manager assesses impact

# Detects: Dependency updates, folder changes, tech stack changes
```

### Checking Standards
```bash
