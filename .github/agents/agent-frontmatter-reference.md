# Custom Agent Frontmatter Reference

This guide explains the 10 supported top-level frontmatter parameters for `.agent.md` files, what each one does, and how to use them effectively.

## 1. description
What it is:
A required discovery string used by the system to decide when this agent should be selected or delegated to.

Purpose:
Improve routing accuracy.

How to use:
- Start with `Use when:` and include task keywords.
- Be specific about domain and output.

Good example:
`description: "Use when: generating technical specifications from canonical NexusBank app requirements."`

## 2. name
What it is:
Agent display name.

Purpose:
Human-readable identity in agent picker and logs.

How to use:
- Keep it short and role-focused.
- Use title case.

Good example:
`name: "Technical Specifier"`

## 3. tools
What it is:
Allowed tool set for the agent.

Purpose:
Security and focus through least privilege.

How to use:
- Include only tools needed for the role.
- Add MCP tools using exact server key wildcard, for example `figma-context-mcp/*`.
- Keep broad aliases only when required.

Good example:
`tools: [read, edit, search, execute, figma-context-mcp/*]`

## 4. user-invocable
What it is:
Visibility control for direct user selection.

Purpose:
Control whether users can pick this agent manually.

How to use:
- Set `true` for user-facing specialist agents.
- Set `false` for internal subagents only.

Good example:
`user-invocable: true`

## 5. model
What it is:
Model selection for this agent.

Purpose:
Pin capability/cost profile for a specific workflow.

How to use:
- Use single model for consistency.
- Use fallback list for resilience.

Good examples:
`model: "GPT-5 (copilot)"`
`model: ["Claude Sonnet 4.5 (copilot)", "GPT-5 (copilot)"]`

## 6. argument-hint
What it is:
Guidance shown to users about what to pass as input.

Purpose:
Improve invocation quality and reduce ambiguous prompts.

How to use:
- Keep it short and action-oriented.
- Mention expected identifiers, paths, or run IDs.

Good example:
`argument-hint: "Provide requirement file path and RUN_ID."`

## 7. agents
What it is:
Allowlist of subagents this agent can invoke.

Purpose:
Constrain orchestration and prevent accidental delegation sprawl.

How to use:
- Omit to allow all available subagents.
- Set explicit list to enforce workflow boundaries.
- Set empty list to prevent any subagent delegation.

Good examples:
`agents: ["Compliance Reviewer", "Traceability Manager"]`
`agents: []`

## 8. disable-model-invocation
What it is:
Flag to prevent this agent from being invoked as a subagent by other agents.

Purpose:
Protect specialized agents from unintended chaining.

How to use:
- Use `true` when the agent should be manually run only.
- Keep `false` for normal reusable specialists.

Good example:
`disable-model-invocation: false`

## 9. handoffs
What it is:
Structured transitions to other agents.

Purpose:
Enable multi-stage workflows with explicit routing.

How to use:
- Define clear transition points and intent.
- Keep handoff targets minimal and deterministic.

Good practice:
Use handoffs for predictable stage boundaries, such as spec generation to compliance review.

## 10. hooks
What it is:
Lifecycle command hooks that run at specific events.

Purpose:
Automate deterministic checks, guardrails, and post-processing.

How to use:
- Add only stable, fast commands.
- Prefer `PreToolUse` for policy enforcement and `PostToolUse` for formatting or checks.
- Keep timeouts explicit.

Example:
```yaml
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - type: command
      command: "./scripts/block-dangerous-cmds.sh"
      timeout: 10
  PostToolUse:
    - type: command
      command: "./scripts/auto-lint.sh"
      timeout: 20
```

## Best-Practice Starter Template

```yaml
---
description: "Use when: <specific task with strong keywords>"
name: "<Role Name>"
tools: [read, search]
user-invocable: true
argument-hint: "Provide <required inputs>."
model: "GPT-5 (copilot)"
---
```

## Best-Practice Checklist

1. Make `description` precise enough to route correctly.
2. Keep `tools` minimal and role-specific.
3. Use exact MCP server keys from `.vscode/mcp.json`.
4. Use `user-invocable: false` for internal orchestration agents.
5. Add `argument-hint` for consistent user input.
6. Use `agents` allowlist if delegation must be controlled.
7. Add hooks only for deterministic and quick checks.
8. Test one real invocation after each frontmatter change.
